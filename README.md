### Hi, I'm Tony Joe! 👋

I'm a _Senior Dev_, **clean code lover and lover of Laravel.**

I'm the best friend of deep work & focusing.
I'm interested in critical thinking, self improvement, personal finance and rock'🤟'roll!

📍 **I’m curious.** I read a lot, listen, study, analyze.\
But I can’t stand fanaticism: I don’t like chasing after the last-minute framework all the time.

🚀 **I'm currently working on** a platform for creators to manage and monetize their subscription content.\
It's a side project. Of course, in Laravel.

👉 I’m looking for partners for my side project.
